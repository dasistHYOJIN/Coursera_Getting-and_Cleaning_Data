# Getting and Cleaning Data
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
This repository contains the following files:

* ```README.md```: provides an overview of the repository and how it works.
* ```CodeBook.md```: describes the contents of the data set.
* ```run_analysis.R```: the R script of the project.
* ```tidy_data.txt```: the tidy data set of the run_analysis script.

## Course Project

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Steps to work on this course project

1. Download the data for the project at [this URL](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
2. Unzip and put into a folder named ```UCI HAR Dataset```.
3. Download ```run_analysis.R``` file. It has to be on the same location with ```UCI HAR Dataset``` folder.
4. Set current directory 

Then, you will be able to execute R script file in RStudio.
